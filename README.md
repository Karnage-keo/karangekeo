Welcome to my space.

Here, I'll showcase some of my current and past projects.

## Cloud computing - Study guides and practise exams

### AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
<br>
As part of my continued effort to understand the AWS Services, and add value to those trying to learn AWS Cloud computing, I developed a study guide for the core Cloud Practitioner exam topics.
<br><br>
With this guide, you will find detailed descriptions of all the concept that will be covered as part of the exam.
<br>
Below, you will also find a free Cloud Practitioner practise exam, which has been created to replicate questions that will present in the exam.

## Real world AWS Projects

### Creating a First Line IT Support Bot

This project was rooted in the desire to find a solution for some of our more common issues that arrived into our service desk, and those in which the team will frequently solve with existing documented knowledge, or by referencing our knowledge base.
